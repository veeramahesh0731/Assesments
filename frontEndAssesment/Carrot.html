                    <h3>Indroduction</h3>
                    <p> Carrot is an important root crop cultivated throughout the world for its fleshy edible roots. Carrot farming is done in the spring, summer, and autumn in temperate climate countries and during winter in tropical and subtropical regions.Roots of carrot are used as a vegetable for soups & curries; graded roots are used as a salad, tender roots as pickles also Carrot halwa and jam are famous.</p>

                    <h3>Soil Requirement For Carrot Farming</h3>
                    <p class="intro-discuss">Carrots can be grown well in a wide variety of soils. However, commercial carrot farming’s ideal soil should be deep, loose, well-drained, and rich in humus.

                        Loamy or sandy loam soils with sufficient quantities of humus are well suited to the cultivation of carrots.
                        
                        The ideal pH range for obtaining a good yield is 5.5-6.5. Soils with pH up to 7.0 can also be used, but too alkaline or acidic soils are unsuitable for this crop.</p>

                <div class="process">
                    <h3>Climate Requirement For Carrot Farming</h3>
                    <p class="intro-discuss">Carrot is a cold-weather crop, and it also does well in warm climates.

                        The optimum temperatures for getting excellent growth is between 16 to 20 °C, while temperatures above 28°C drastically reduce top growth.
                        
                        Temperatures lower than 16°C affect the development of color and result in long slender roots, while higher temperatures produce shorter and thicker roots.</p>

                <div class="process">
                    <h3>Propagation</h3>

                    <p class="describe">Carrots are propagated using seeds.</p>
                    <p class="intro-discuss">The carrot seeds that are Sowing or broadcast in the field with a seed rate of 5 to 6 kg /ha or it can be up to 6 to 9 kg/ha this depends upon carrot variety.

                        The seeds are small, approximately 800 per gram. They remain viable for nearly three years and up to 85% germination.
                        
                        However, the germination of some local varieties may be inadequate. Therefore, it is necessary to ascertain the germination percentage when calculating the seed requirement.
                        
                        It is also necessary for the best results to procure clean, healthy, and viable seeds from reliable sources. The seeds take approximately 7-21 days for complete germination.</p>

                <div class="process">
                    <h3>Planting of Carrot</h3>
                    <img id="carrotfarming3" src="/home/z0406@ad.ziffity.com/Documents/Assesment/Carrot-Farming2.jpg" alt="Carrot-Farming3">
                    <p class="describe">Carrots Planting</p>
                    <p class="intro-discuss">The soil for carrot cultivation should be properly prepared to get the desired yield. Therefore the field must provide a loose, friable, deep, and well-drained for seeds to germinate. This can be achieved by repeated deep plowing at least 20-30 cm deep followed by harrowing, leveling, and cleaning.

                        All old debris or remains of previous crops should be removed completely to obtain the desired seedbed condition. Since the seeds are very small and delicate, the seedbed should be very finely prepared. Beds of convenient size should be prepared before sowing.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="process">
                    <h3>Intercultural Operations</h3>
                    <p class="intro-discuss">Weeds compete with the crop; therefore, Weeds can be controlled mechanically, by hand, mulching, and chemically or by combining all these methods.</p>
                    <h2>Transplantation in Brinjal Farming:</h2>
                    <img id="carrotfarming4" src="/home/z0406@ad.ziffity.com/Documents/Assesment/Carrot-Farming3.jpg" alt="Carrot-Farming4">
                    <p class="intro-discuss">It should be done at 60 to 70 days after sowing to help in the development of roots. The soil is earthed up covered the top of developing roots to prevent loss of colour of tops; the tops become green and toxic when exposed to sunlight.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="process">
                    <h3>Harvesting</h3>
                    <p class="intro-discuss">Early carrots are harvested when they are partially developed. For distinct markets, otherwise, they are retained in the soil till they reach the full maturity stage they should not be retained full maturity stage because they become hard and is unfit for consumption.

                        Carrots are harvested when the roots are about 1.8 cm or larger in diameter at the upper end. The soil may be loosened with a special plow (carrot lifter) or an ordinary plow.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="process">
                    <h3>Yield</h3>
                    <p class="intro-discuss">Carrot yield is deferring varies to the variety. In tropical types varies, it gives around 20 to 30 tons per hectare, and in temperate type, variety may give 10 to 15 tons per hectare.</p>
