                    <h3>Indroduction of Brinjal</h3>
                    <p class="intro-discuss"> Brinjal or Eggplant is an important crop of subtropics and tropics. The name brinjal is popular in Indian subcontinents and is derived from Arabic and Sanskrit whereas the name eggplant has been derived from the shape of the fruit of some varieties, which are white and resemble in shape to chicken eggs. It is also called aubergine (French word) in Europe. The brinjal is of much importance in the warm areas of the Far East, being grown extensively in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, China, and the Philippines. It is also popular in Egypt, France, Italy, and the United States. In India, it is one of the most common, popular and principal vegetable crops grown throughout the country except higher altitudes. It is a versatile crop adapted to different agro-climatic regions and can be grown throughout the year. It is a perennial but grown commercially as an annual crop. A number of cultivars are grown in India, consumer preference being dependent upon fruit color, size, and shape.</p>

                    <h3>The Climatic Requirement for Brinjal Production</h3>
                    <p class="intro-discuss">The brinjal is a warm season crop, therefore susceptible to severe frost. Low temperature during the cool season causes deformation of vegetables. A long and warm growing season is desirable for successful brinjal farming. Cool nights and short summers are not suitable for satisfactory production. A daily average temperature of 13 to 21°C is most favorable for optimum growth and yield. The brinjal seed germinates well @ 25°C.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="process">
                    <h3>Soil Preparation for Brinjal Plantation</h3>
                    <p class="intro-discuss">The brinjal plants can be grown in all types of soil varying from light sandy to heavy clay. Well-drained soil is rich in organic matter with a pH of 6.5-7.5. Light soils are good for an early yield, while clay-loam and silt-loam are well suited for higher yield.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="process">
                    <h3>Brinjal Seed Treatment Procedure</h3>
                    <p class="intro-discuss">Treat the brinjal seeds with Trichoderma viride @ 4 g / kg or Pseudomonas fluorescens @ 10 g / kg of seed. Treat the seeds with Azospirillum @ 40 g / 400 g of seeds using rice gruel as adhesive. Irrigate with a rose can. In raised nursery beds, sow the seeds in lines at 10 cm apart and cover with sand. Transplant the seedlings 30 – 35 days after sowing at 60 cm apart in the ridges.</p>
                    <h2>Transplantation in Brinjal Farming:</h2>
                    <img id="brinjalfarming4" src="/home/z0406@ad.ziffity.com/Documents/Assesment/Brinjal-Farming4.jpg" alt="Brinjal-Farming4">
                    <p class="intro-discuss">The seedlings are ready in 4-5 weeks for transplanting, when they attained a height of 12-15 cm with 3-to 4leavess. Harden the seedlings by withholding irrigation. Uproot the seedlings carefully without injury to the roots. Transplanting should be done during evening hours followed by irrigation. Firmly press the soil around the seedlings. Spacing depends upon the fertility status of soil, type of verities and suitability of the season. In general 60×60 cm spacing is kept for non-spreading type verities and 75-90×60-75 cm for spreading type verities</p>
